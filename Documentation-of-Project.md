This prototype represents our initial attempt to shred plastic bottles. However, this particular iteration did not achieve the desired outcome of effectively cutting the plastic bottles. Our approach involved utilizing wheel bearings, whereby one side of the bearing was ground down to create a sharp edge. Additionally, we adjusted the height of one bearing to ensure proper pinching of the plastic bottle. However, due to an excessive gap between the bearings, the intended pinching mechanism did not function as intended. As a result, the wheel bearings only left minor marks on the plastic bottles, failing to achieve the intended shredding functionality.

The second iteration of our component proved successful in effectively shredding plastic bottles. This achievement was facilitated by implementing a guidance system that directed the plastic bottle between two bearings. Furthermore, we enhanced the cutting mechanism by utilizing a razor to efficiently slice through the plastic material. As a result, the desired outcome of shredding the plastic bottles was accomplished.
