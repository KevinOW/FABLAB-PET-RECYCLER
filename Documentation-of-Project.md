This prototype represents our initial attempt to shred plastic bottles. However, this particular iteration did not achieve the desired outcome of effectively cutting the plastic bottles. Our approach involved utilizing wheel bearings, whereby one side of the bearing was ground down to create a sharp edge. Additionally, we adjusted the height of one bearing to ensure proper pinching of the plastic bottle. However, due to an excessive gap between the bearings, the intended pinching mechanism did not function as intended. As a result, the wheel bearings only left minor marks on the plastic bottles, failing to achieve the intended shredding functionality.

The second iteration of our component proved successful in effectively shredding the plastic bottle. This achievement was facilitated by implementing a guidance system that directed the plastic bottle between two bearings. Furthermore, we enhanced the cutting mechanism by utilizing a razor to efficiently slice through the plastic material. As a result, the desired outcome of shredding the plastic bottles was accomplished.

The third iteration of our plastic bottle cutting device demonstrates significant improvements. Firstly, we have optimized the 3D print time, reducing the overall production time. Additionally, we have incorporated a screw with a guiding mechanism that ensures consistent cutting throughout the entire process by effectively directing the plastic. Moreover, we have enhanced the attachment area for the razor blade by adjusting certain angles to achieve a better fit. These enhancements collectively enhance the functionality and efficiency of the device, resulting in improved performance and reliability.
