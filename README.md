# PET Recycler Project

This project is associated with the summer courses at the University of Halmstad in Sweden and is affiliated with Stena Recycling, a renowned company. The objective of this project is to develop a sustainable and recyclable product. Our primary focus is to design a PET recycling machine, leveraging predominantly 3D printed components to ensure optimal sustainability and global accessibility. The proposed machine will effectively convert PET bottles into filament suitable for 3D printers.


## Description
The collaborative endeavor between FABLab Halmstad in Sweden and Stena Recycling, a prominent company known for its commitment to sustainability. The project's core aim is the development of a highly sustainable and recyclable product with a strong emphasis on environmental responsibility. Specifically, the team aims to create a PET recycling machine that utilizes 3D printing technology. By employing predominantly 3D printed components, the machine not only maximizes sustainability but also ensures widespread accessibility for users worldwide. Its primary function will be the transformation of PET bottles into high-quality filament, catering to the growing demand for sustainable materials in the 3D printing industry.

This prototype represents our initial attempt to shred plastic bottles. However, this particular iteration did not achieve the desired outcome of effectively cutting the plastic bottles. Our approach involved utilizing wheel bearings, whereby one side of the bearing was ground down to create a sharp edge. Additionally, we adjusted the height of one bearing to ensure proper pinching of the plastic bottle. However, due to an excessive gap between the bearings, the intended pinching mechanism did not function as intended. As a result, the wheel bearings only left minor marks on the plastic bottles, failing to achieve the intended shredding functionality.

The second iteration of our component proved successful in effectively shredding plastic bottles. This achievement was facilitated by implementing a guidance system that directed the plastic bottle between two bearings. Furthermore, we enhanced the cutting mechanism by utilizing a razor to efficiently slice through the plastic material. As a result, the desired outcome of shredding the plastic bottles was accomplished.
