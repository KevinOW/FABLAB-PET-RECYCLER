# PET RECYCLER - HALMSTAD FABLAB

This project is associated with the summer courses at the University of Halmstad in Sweden and is affiliated with Stena Recycling, a renowned company. The objective of this project is to develop a sustainable and recyclable product. Our primary focus is to design a PET recycling machine, leveraging predominantly 3D printed components to ensure optimal sustainability and global accessibility. The proposed machine will effectively convert PET bottles into filament suitable for 3D printers.
